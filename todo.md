# TODO

* Make a "scratchpad":
  * This can likely be done by making a tag that when toggled, makes all
  of it's clients sticky. But ideally, this tag can also be viewed on
  it's own.
* Make floating bar:
  * This can be done by setting the background on the widgets themselves
  instead of the entire bar. Then using a transparent border to act as a
  makeshift margin.
* Create comfy keybindings
